Feature: Resource Planning Filter

  Scenario: Filter resources by allocation date
    Given I open the intranet dashboard
    When I click on the username to log in
    And I navigate to Project Operations > Resource Planning
    And I set the allocation date filter from "2025-05-05" to "2025-05-09"
    And I click on the search button
    Then I should see the filtered resource list
